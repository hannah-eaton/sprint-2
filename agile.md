I have previously used the waterfall method in my work at uni. 
I found I would always have problems coming towards the end of a project. 
From results like these I changed to creating iterations of my work much like the iterative incremental model. 
I would be able to reflect back on my work, and would see what needed to be changed, and would make the changes, 
till I was happy with the completed outcome.
