Design for the user and their tasks

User comes first as it is the user that is using the system first and fore most. The system is there to help and support and aid the user in what tasks they wish to complete.

Be consistent

Make the design/aesthetic/function consistent. Will then be easier for the user to operate. User doesn’t want obstatcles in their way while trying to use.

Use simple and natural dialogue

Don’t overwhelm the user with information. Keep it simple. Be consistent with the choices of word/terminology.

Reduce unnecessary mental effort by the user 

Simplicity is key. Users should not have to worry about whether the system will work while they are trying to complete their task. Want users to have a system that is efficient when creating/completing tasks.

Provide adequate feedback

The system should be interacting with the user, and needs to show feedback with tasks the user completes. Though keep it simple with what feedback the user receives, don’t overwhelm the user with data and unnecessary stats.

Provide adequate navigation

Let the user clearly see where they are located within the system. Having titles, numbers, scroll bar etc. Let it be easy for the user to navigate throughout the system, and to go and return where they came and want to go, without getting lost.

Let the user drive

The user should be able to easily complete the task they wish to without constrant.

Present information clearly

Keep it consistent when displaying information on screen. Don’t provide the user with unnecessary information.

Be helpful

If the user needs help on the system let it be clearly shown where they can find it. However though to start with the system should be self explanatory. 

Reduce errors

To reduce errors the system should gently guide the user through but not limit/handicap what the user can and can’t do. If an error is to occur the user should be informed with a notification, but don’t blame the user if an error is to occur, assist them on how they can fix it, or prevent it from happening next time.

To me I think the most important is to be consistent, and design for the user and their tasks. As at the end of the day you want to create a system that is simple and easy for the user to interact with. All these though are key principles of user centered design, and for different systems some of the principles may become less or more important. Also personal preference for whoever is creating the system. But it may change depending on the feedback from users.
